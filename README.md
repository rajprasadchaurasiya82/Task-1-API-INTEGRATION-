🧾 Introduction
The Weather Casting Web App is a simple yet effective weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input any city name and receive real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. This project demonstrates how front-end technologies can interact with real-world APIs to create functional, interactive web experiences.

📦 What This Project Includes
A responsive and clean HTML structure.

A CSS stylesheet for layout and design styling.

A JavaScript script to handle API calls, dynamic content rendering, and user interaction.

Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data.

User-friendly alerts and error handling for better UX.

✨ Key Features
🔍 City-based weather search

📡 Live weather data from OpenWeatherMap

🧾 Temperature, condition, humidity, and wind info

✅ Responsive & centered layout

🛑 Error messages for invalid input or fetch failures

📱 Mobile-friendly design

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML5 – for structuring the page

CSS3 – for styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – for logic, DOM interaction, and API integration

OpenWeatherMap API – for weather data

📚 What I Learned
How to fetch and display real-time data from an API

Error handling in asynchronous JavaScript (try-catch)

Manipulating the DOM dynamically with innerHTML

Organizing a clean folder structure (index.html, style.css, script.js)

Improving UX through loading messages and alert popups

Basics of flexbox and responsive design with CSS

🗂 Sections of the Website
Header Section – Displays the app title

Input Field – User enters city name

Button – Triggers API request via getWeather()

Weather Result Section – Displays live data (or error messages)

JavaScript Alert – Greets the user on page load

💡 Final Thoughts
This project helped me bridge the gap between static design and dynamic functionality. By using a real-world API and implementing clean UI practices, I now better understand how front-end apps communicate with external services. There is potential for expansion, such as adding 5-day forecasts, maps, or saving recent searches in localStorage.

This Weather App project lays a solid foundation for building more advanced, data-driven web applications in the future.
